# Algorithm Visualizer

## Description

The Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive React application designed to help users understand and visualize two fundamental algorithms in computer science: **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and **Huffman Coding**. This project provides a clear and engaging way to explore the concepts, workings, and applications of these algorithms through visual representations.

## Features

### Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization
- Input a graph represented as nodes and edges to visualize how Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes.
- Step-by-step execution illustrating the algorithmâ€™s decision-making process, including updates to distances and the selected path.
- Dropdown menu to switch between different graph configurations for enhanced learning.

### Huffman Coding Visualization
- Visualizes the process of building a Huffman Tree based on character frequencies from input text.
- Users can enter a string, and the application displays the frequency table, constructed Huffman Tree, and generated Huffman codes in real time.
- 'Next' button for step-by-step execution, allowing users to see tree evolution and changes in encoded and decoded outputs.

### Interactive User Interface
- Modern UI with attractive color schemes inspired by popular design patterns.
- Easy navigation between sections dedicated to Dijkstra's Algorithm and Huffman Coding.
- Enhanced visual elements, such as animated transitions and color coding, for intuitive learning.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, CSS Modules for styling
- **Visualization Libraries:** [react-d3-graph, react-d3-tree]
- **other Libraries:** [react-pdf, pdfjs-dist]
